Example inventory
-----------------

The ``progeekro.lldpd`` role is included by default in the :file:`common.yml`
ProGeek playbook; you don't need to do anything to have it executed.

If you donâ€™t want to let ``progeekro.lldpd`` role install and configure the
service, you can disable it with the following setting in your inventory:

.. code-block:: yaml

   lldpd__enabled: False


Ansible tags
------------

You can use Ansible ``--tags`` or ``--skip-tags`` parameters to limit what
tasks are performed during Ansible run. This can be used after a host was first
configured to speed up playbook execution, when you are sure that most of the
configuration is already in the desired state.

Available role tags:

``role::lldpd``
  Main role tag, should be used in the playbook to execute all of the role
  tasks as well as role dependencies.
